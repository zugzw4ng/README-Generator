  ## Description 

I created a `README.md` file generator that operates within the command line. Powered by Node.js and the Inquirer package, this application is simple to install and will run with a simple command.

  ## Installation
 
 To run the program and generate a README for your current working directory, run `npm install` to install the packages required.
  
  ## Usage 
  
The program can be invoked with `node index.js` and you will be prompted with a series of input fields to fill the markdown for your `README.md`  

  ## Tests
  
  Here is a link to an example README.md created by the program:
